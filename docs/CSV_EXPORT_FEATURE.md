## Technical Implementation

### CSV Field Escaping

The export function properly handles CSV field escaping:

- Fields containing commas, quotes, or newlines are wrapped in double quotes
- Internal double quotes are escaped by doubling them
- Null and undefined values are converted to empty strings
- Numbers are converted to strings

### Export Process

1. User clicks "Export to CSV" button
2. Current table data is gathered (respecting filters, sorts, and groupings)
3. Data is formatted into CSV structure
4. CSV content is generated with proper escaping
5. File is automatically downloaded with descriptive filename

### File Naming Convention

- Budget Management: `budget-management-2024-2024-06-26T14-30-15.csv`
- Monthly Flat View: `monthly-breakdown-flat-2024-2024-06-26T14-30-15.csv`
- Monthly Grouped: `monthly-breakdown-grouped-by-finance-2024-2024-06-26T14-30-15.csv`

  - Individual vendors nested under groups
  - Grand totals at the bottom

## Error Handling

- Export buttons are disabled when no vendor data exists
- CSV generation handles edge cases like empty fields, special characters
- File download uses browser's native download mechanism

## Browser Compatibility

- Works in all modern browsers that support:
  - Blob API for file generation
  - Document.createElement for download links
  - URL.createObjectURL for file URLs

## File Size Considerations

- Large datasets (1000+ vendors) will generate correspondingly large CSV files
- Monthly breakdown exports are typically larger due to 12 monthly columns
- Grouped views include additional metadata rows
