## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### **When Ready to Begin Phase 4.2:**

1. **Verify Phase 4.1 Complete**:

   ```bash
   npm run start:planning
   # Navigate to Global Assumptions and verify no overlapping
   ```

2. **Create Engine Directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/utils/planningEngines
   cd src/utils/planningEngines
   ```

3. **Start with Historical Trend Engine**:

   - Create `types.ts` with engine interfaces
   - Implement `historicalTrendEngine.ts`
   - Add unit tests
   - Integrate with wizard

4. **Continue with Other Engines**:
   - Implement percentage growth engine (easiest)
   - Implement zero-based engine (most complex)
   - Create unified integration layer

## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

### **Engine Input**:

```typescript
interface EngineInput {
  method: "historical-trend" | "zero-based" | "percentage-growth";
  targetYear: number;
  baseYear: number;
  historicalData: BudgetEntry[];
  globalAssumptions: GlobalAssumptions;
  categoryOverrides?: CategoryOverride[];
}
```

### **Engine Output**:

```typescript
interface EngineOutput {
  planningData: PlanningBudgetEntry[];
  insights: PlanningInsight[];
  confidence: number;
  methodology: string;
  metadata: EngineMetadata;
}
```
