# Budget Totals Feature Implementation

## Summary

Added two new total rows to the Monthly Breakdown table in the Budget Tracker application:

- **"Total In Budget"** - sums vendors where `inBudget = true`
- **"Total Not in Budget"** - sums vendors where `inBudget = false`

## Changes Made

### 1. VendorManagement.tsx

- Added `calculateInBudgetMonthlyTotals()` function to filter and calculate totals for vendors with `inBudget = true`
- Added `calculateNotInBudgetMonthlyTotals()` function to filter and calculate totals for vendors with `inBudget = false`
- Added two new total rows above the existing "Monthly Totals" row in both:
  - Grouped view (when vendors are grouped by finance category or category)
  - Individual view (when vendors are shown individually)
- Each new total row includes:
  - Monthly breakdown totals for each month (Jan-Dec)
  - Grand total for the respective group

### 2. vendor-management.css

- Added specific styling for the new total rows:
  - `.monthly-totals-row.in-budget-totals` - styled with primary blue background
  - `.monthly-totals-row.not-in-budget-totals` - styled with warning orange background
  - Both rows have slightly darker grand total columns for emphasis

## Visual Layout

The Monthly Breakdown table now shows totals in this order:

1. **Total In Budget** (blue background)
2. **Total Not in Budget** (orange background)
3. **Monthly Totals** (green background - existing)

## Features

- ✅ Separate calculation functions for filtered totals
- ✅ Proper styling with distinct colors for each total type
- ✅ Works in both grouped and individual view modes
- ✅ Includes monthly breakdown and grand totals
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality
- ✅ No syntax errors or conflicts

## Usage

Users can now see at a glance:

- How much budget is allocated to vendors marked as "In Budget"
- How much budget is allocated to vendors marked as "Not in Budget"
- The overall monthly distribution for each category
