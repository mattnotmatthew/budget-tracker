## Feature Details

### 1. Vendor Concentration Analysis

**Purpose**: Identify vendor spending concentration and potential over-dependence risks.

**Metrics Provided**:
- **Total Vendors**: Count of all vendors in the system
- **Active Vendors**: Vendors with actual spending activity
- **Top 5/10 Concentration**: Percentage of spend concentrated in top vendors
- **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)**: Industry-standard concentration measurement
- **New vs Recurring Vendors**: Portfolio growth and stability analysis

**Key Insights**:
- Highlights when too much spend is concentrated in few vendors
- Identifies single-source dependencies by category
- Tracks vendor portfolio diversification over time

### 2. Risk Analysis & Dependencies

**Purpose**: Assess vendor-related risks and critical dependencies.

**Risk Scoring Factors**:
1. **Concentration Risk** (0-30 points): Based on percentage of total spend
2. **Budget Variance Risk** (0-25 points): Deviation from allocated budgets
3. **Contract Risk** (0-20 points): Single-source dependencies
4. **Payment Volatility Risk** (0-15 points): Inconsistent spending patterns
5. **Category Diversification Risk** (0-10 points): Vendors spanning multiple categories

**Risk Levels**:
- **Critical** (80-100 points): Immediate action required
- **High** (60-79 points): Mitigation planning needed
- **Medium** (40-59 points): Monitor closely
- **Low** (0-39 points): Acceptable risk level

**Dependency Analysis**:
- Single-source dependencies by category
- Critical vendor identification
- Contract renewal risk assessment
- Category risk profiles with concentration indices

### 3. Billing & Contract Analysis

**Purpose**: Understand cash flow commitments and billing patterns.

**Features**:
- **Billing Type Distribution**: Breakdown by monthly, quarterly, annual, one-time
- **Cash Flow Impact**: Commitments by payment frequency
- **Budget Status Analysis**: In-budget vs off-budget vendor tracking
- **Payment Schedule Visibility**: Future cash flow requirements

### 4. Spend Velocity & Utilization

**Purpose**: Track the rate of vendor budget consumption and project runway.

**Key Metrics** (with interactive tooltips):
- **Total Budget**: Sum of all vendor budget allocations
- **Actual Spend**: Year-to-date vendor spending
- **Utilization Rate**: Percentage of budget consumed
- **Monthly Burn Rate**: Average monthly vendor spending

**Category Velocity Analysis**:
- Budget vs actual by category
- Utilization rates with visual indicators
- Variance tracking (positive/negative)

**Projections**:
- Projected runway at current burn rate
- Over/under utilization warnings
- Pacing guidance based on time elapsed

### 5. Seasonal Patterns & Trends

**Purpose**: Identify cyclical spending patterns for better planning.

**Analysis Includes**:
- Monthly spending patterns
- Peak spending periods identification
- Seasonal variance from average
- Predictable vs unpredictable spending

### 6. Optimization Opportunities

**Purpose**: Identify actionable cost savings and efficiency improvements.

**Opportunity Types**:
- **Consolidation**: Similar vendors that could be combined
- **Underutilized**: Low utilization suggesting over-budgeting
- **Over-budget**: Vendors consistently exceeding allocations
- **Seasonal Optimization**: Opportunities based on usage patterns

**Prioritization**:
- High/Medium/Low priority indicators
- Potential savings calculations
- Specific recommendations per opportunity

### 7. Compliance & Data Quality

**Purpose**: Ensure vendor data integrity and audit readiness.

**Metrics Tracked**:
- **Data Completeness**: Percentage of required fields populated
- **Tracking Accuracy**: Monthly data coverage
- **Budget Compliance**: Percentage within approved budgets
- **Audit Readiness Score**: Composite compliance metric

**Audit Findings**:
- Automated identification of compliance gaps
- Severity ratings (High/Medium/Low)
- Specific remediation recommendations

## User Interface Design

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Main Section Header**: Collapsible with compact summary when collapsed
2. **Key Insights Summary**: 4 primary KPIs with tooltips
3. **Risk Insights**: Priority-ordered actionable items
4. **Sub-sections**: Each analysis area in its own collapsible panel

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Tooltips**: All metrics have detailed explanations
- **Collapsible Sections**: Manage information density
- **Color Coding**: Risk levels and performance indicators
- **Responsive Tables**: Sortable data with clear formatting

### Styling Approach
- Consistent with existing Executive Summary design
- Responsive grid layouts for various screen sizes
- Visual indicators for risk levels and performance
- Print-friendly formatting

## Technical Architecture

### Modular Design
Following the established pattern of separation of concerns:
- **Calculation utilities**: Pure functions for data processing
- **Components**: React components with clear props interfaces
- **Styles**: Dedicated CSS with BEM-like naming conventions
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- `useMemo` hooks for expensive calculations
- Lazy evaluation of sub-sections
- Efficient data filtering and aggregation

### Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrated with existing budget context
- Reuses existing tooltip infrastructure
- Extends print/export functionality
