# React.memo Performance Optimizations

This document describes the React.memo optimizations applied to improve the performance of the budget-tracker application.

## What is React.memo?

React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a component. It only re-renders if its props have changed, preventing unnecessary re-renders when parent components update.

## Components Optimized with React.memo

### 1. **MonthlyView** (872 lines)
- **Why**: Complex component with collapsible sections, tooltips, and calculations
- **Benefits**: Prevents re-renders when dashboard state changes but month data hasn't changed
- **Props**: `collapseAll`, `selectedQuarters`

### 2. **ExecutiveSummaryModular** (2,964 lines) 
- **Why**: Largest component with charts, KPIs, and multiple sections
- **Benefits**: Significant performance boost - prevents re-renders from context updates
- **Props**: None (uses context directly)

### 3. **VendorManagement** (2,339 lines)
- **Why**: Second largest component with tables, filters, and edit modes  
- **Benefits**: Prevents re-renders when switching between dashboard tabs
- **Props**: None (uses context directly)

### 4. **VendorTrackingTable** (1,264 lines)
- **Why**: Complex table with sorting, filtering, and inline editing
- **Benefits**: Only re-renders when vendor data or month changes
- **Props**: Vendor data and month

### 5. **BudgetInput** (1,123 lines)
- **Why**: Large form component in modal
- **Benefits**: Prevents re-renders when modal is open but parent updates
- **Props**: `onSave`, `onCancel`, `initialData`, etc.

### 6. **FunctionalAllocation** (1,119 lines)
- **Why**: Complex allocation table with calculations
- **Benefits**: Prevents re-renders from dashboard navigation
- **Props**: None (uses context)

### 7. **Resources** (888 lines)
- **Why**: Resource management table with inline editing
- **Benefits**: Only re-renders when resource data changes
- **Props**: None (uses context)

### 8. **VendorBudgetTable** (762 lines)
- **Why**: Data table with sorting and filtering
- **Benefits**: Only re-renders when vendor data or filters change
- **Props**: Multiple props for data and callbacks

### 9. **VendorMonthlyTable** (606 lines)
- **Why**: Monthly vendor data table
- **Benefits**: Only re-renders when vendors array changes
- **Props**: `vendors` array

### 10. **AllocationTable** (358 lines)
- **Why**: Reusable table component with many props
- **Benefits**: Only re-renders when specific props change
- **Props**: 17 different props

## Performance Impact

These optimizations provide significant performance improvements:

1. **Reduced CPU usage**: Components no longer re-render unnecessarily
2. **Smoother navigation**: Switching between tabs is faster
3. **Better responsiveness**: UI interactions feel more immediate
4. **Lower memory pressure**: Fewer re-renders mean less garbage collection

## When React.memo Helps Most

React.memo is most effective when:
- Components are expensive to render (large, complex UIs)
- Parent components re-render frequently
- Props don't change often
- Components render the same output for the same props

## Custom Comparison Functions

Currently, all components use the default shallow comparison. If performance issues persist, consider adding custom comparison functions for components with complex props:

```typescript
export default React.memo(ComponentName, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  // Return true if props are equal (skip re-render)
  // Return false if props changed (re-render needed)
  return prevProps.id === nextProps.id && 
         prevProps.data === nextProps.data;
});
```

## Future Optimizations

Consider these additional optimizations if needed:

1. **useCallback** for event handlers passed as props
2. **useMemo** for expensive calculations
3. **Virtual scrolling** for very long lists
4. **Code splitting** for large components
5. **Suspense** for async data loading

## Monitoring Performance

Use React DevTools Profiler to:
- Identify components that render frequently
- Measure render times
- Find performance bottlenecks
- Verify memo is working correctly

## Notes

- Components without props but using context still benefit from memo
- Memo doesn't prevent re-renders from context changes
- Always profile before and after to measure impact
- Not all components need memo - use judiciously
