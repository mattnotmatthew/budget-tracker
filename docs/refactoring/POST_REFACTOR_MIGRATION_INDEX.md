# Post-Refactor Component Migration Index

This document provides a comprehensive guide to all new components created during the refactoring and their migration documentation.

## Overview

The refactoring introduced a feature-based architecture with:
- Shared components for reusability
- Service layer for business logic
- Utility modules for calculations and formatting
- Feature-based organization

## New Components Requiring Migration

### 1. BaseTable Component
**Location**: `src/components/shared/BaseTable/`
**Migration Doc**: [BaseTable Migration Guide](../components/BaseTable-README.md)
**Purpose**: Unified table component to replace multiple table implementations

**Components to migrate to BaseTable:**
- `VendorBudgetTable`
- `VendorMonthlyTable`
- `VendorTrackingTable`
- `AllocationTable`

### 2. DataExportService
**Location**: `src/services/DataExportService.ts`
**Migration Doc**: [DataExportService Migration Guide](./DataExportService.migration.md)
**Purpose**: Unified export service for CSV, Excel, PDF, and PowerPoint

**Components to migrate:**
- All components with export functionality
- Remove individual export utilities
- Use `exportAdapters.ts` for backward compatibility

### 3. VendorManagement (Refactored)
**Location**: `src/features/vendors/components/`
**Migration Doc**: [VendorManagement Migration Guide](./VendorManagement-migration.md)
**Status**: Two versions exist:
- `VendorManagement.tsx` (original)
- `VendorManagementRefactored.tsx` (new modular version)

**Migration involves:**
- Switching imports from original to refactored version
- Updating parent components to use new props structure

### 4. ExecutiveSummary (Refactored)
**Location**: `src/features/reports/components/ExecutiveSummary/`
**Migration Doc**: [ExecutiveSummary Migration Guide](./ExecutiveSummary-migration.md)
**Status**: Three versions exist:
- `ExecutiveSummary.tsx` (original)
- `ExecutiveSummaryModular.tsx` (intermediate)
- `ExecutiveSummaryRefactored.tsx` (final modular version)

**Migration involves:**
- Switching to tab-based architecture
- Using new hook-based data management
- Updating export functionality

## New Utility Modules

### Calculation Utilities
**Location**: `src/utils/calculations/`
- `aggregationCalculations.ts` - Sum, average, grouping functions
- `percentageCalculations.ts` - Percentage calculations
- `trendCalculations.ts` - Trend analysis
- `varianceCalculations.ts` - Budget variance calculations

### Formatter Utilities
**Location**: `src/utils/formatters/`
- `dateFormatters.ts` - Date formatting functions
- `numberFormatters.ts` - Currency and number formatting
- `textFormatters.ts` - Text manipulation utilities

### Date Utilities
**Location**: `src/utils/dates/`
- `dateUtils.ts` - Quarter calculations, date operations

## Migration Priority

### High Priority
1. **Switch to VendorManagementRefactored** - Most user-facing impact
2. **Switch to ExecutiveSummaryRefactored** - Critical reporting feature
3. **Migrate export functionality to DataExportService** - Consistency

### Medium Priority
1. **Migrate tables to BaseTable** - Code maintainability
2. **Update utility imports** - Use new organized utilities

### Low Priority
1. **Remove deprecated files** - Cleanup after migration
2. **Update tests** - Ensure new components are tested

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Update imports in `App.tsx` or routing components
- [ ] Test VendorManagement functionality after migration
- [ ] Test ExecutiveSummary all tabs and exports
- [ ] Verify export functionality works across all formats
- [ ] Update any custom styling that relied on old component structure
- [ ] Remove old component files after successful migration
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new architecture

## Benefits After Migration

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Eliminated duplicate code
2. **Better Performance**: React.memo optimizations applied
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Consistency**: Unified patterns across the application
5. **Scalability**: Feature-based architecture for growth
