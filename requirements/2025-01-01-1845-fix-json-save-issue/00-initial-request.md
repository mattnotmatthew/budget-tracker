# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-01 18:45:00
**User Request:** fix issue where a new json file is created every time a save button is clicked.

## Context
The user is experiencing an issue where clicking the save button creates a new JSON file each time instead of overwriting or properly saving to the existing file. This suggests a problem with file handling, file system access API usage, or save logic implementation.

## Initial Problem Understanding
- Save functionality is creating multiple files instead of updating existing file
- This affects file management workflow and creates clutter
- May indicate issues with file handle persistence or browser API limitations
